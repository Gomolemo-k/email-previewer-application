- Component-driven development for UI elements
- Type-safe development across the entire stack
- Internationalization-first design
- Feature module organization

### Core Principles

1. **Component-Driven Development**: UI components built in isolation using Radix UI primitives and TailwindCSS
2. **Server-First Architecture**: Leveraging Next.js Server Actions and React Server Components
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety using TypeScript across the entire stack
4. **Internationalization-First**: All content internationalized by default using next-intl
5. **Feature Module Organization**: Related functionality grouped into feature modules
6. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript, enhanced when available

```

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend UI
2. UI sends requests to Next.js Server Actions for data mutations
3. Server Actions process business logic and interact with the database or external services
4. Database stores/retrieves application data
5. External services handle payments, email delivery, AI processing, and storage
6. Client-side state management handles UI state that doesn't need to be shared

### Component Structure

#### Frontend Component Organization

The frontend components are organized by feature:
- **Admin Components**: Admin dashboard and user management
- **Auth Components**: Authentication flows and UI elements
- **Dashboard Components**: User dashboard elements
- **Docs Components**: Documentation UI elements
- **Layout Components**: Global layout elements (header, footer, etc.)
- **Pricing Components**: Pricing page elements
- **Settings Components**: User settings UI
- **Shared Components**: Reusable components across features
- **UI Components**: Low-level UI primitives and design system components

#### Backend Services Organization

Backend services are organized by feature:
- **Auth Actions**: Authentication-related Server Actions
- **Payment Actions**: Payment processing Server Actions
- **User Actions**: User management Server Actions
- **Content Actions**: Content management Server Actions
- **AI Actions**: AI feature Server Actions
- **Email Actions**: Email sending Server Actions

### Database Design

#### Schema Overview

The database schema consists of several core tables:
1. **User Table**: User accounts and profiles
2. **Session Table**: User sessions and authentication tokens
3. **Account Table**: User account connections to social providers
4. **Verification Table**: Email verification and password reset tokens
5. **Payment Table**: Payment records and subscription information
6. **User Credit Table**: User credit balances for pay-per-use features
7. **Credit Transaction Table**: Credit usage and purchase records

#### Relationships

- Users have one-to-many relationships with sessions, accounts, payments, and credit records
- Sessions are tied to specific users
- Accounts represent social provider connections for users
- Payments are associated with users and their subscription status
- User credits track available credits for pay-per-use features
- Credit transactions record all credit usage and purchases

#### Indexing Strategy

Tables are indexed for performance:
- User ID indexes on all related tables
- Email unique index on user table
- Payment status and type indexes
- Credit transaction type indexes

### API Design

#### Server Actions

Server Actions are used for all data mutations:
- Authentication actions (login, register, logout, password reset)
- User management actions (profile updates, settings changes)
- Payment actions (subscription management, one-time payments)
- Content actions (blog posts, documentation updates)
- Credit actions (credit purchases, usage tracking)

#### API Routes

Traditional API routes are used for specific integrations:
- Webhook endpoints for payment providers
- Analytics event tracking
- Sitemap and robots.txt generation

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization

- Better Auth for authentication with social providers
- Cookie-based session management
- Role-based access control for admin features
- Email verification workflows
- Password reset flows

#### Data Protection

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Database connection pooling
- Input validation with Zod
- SQL injection prevention through Drizzle ORM
- Proper error handling to avoid information leakage

#### API Security

- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- CSRF protection for forms
- Input sanitization for all user data
- Secure headers configuration
- Content Security Policy implementation
