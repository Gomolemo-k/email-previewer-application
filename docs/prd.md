# Email Previewer Application Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source

- IDE-based fresh analysis

#### Current Project State

The existing project is the MkSaaS template, a comprehensive Next.js boilerplate designed to accelerate the development of profitable SaaS applications. It includes essential SaaS features such as authentication, payments, internationalization, newsletter management, dashboard, blog, documentation, and UI components. The primary purpose is to enable developers to build and deploy SaaS applications rapidly.

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type

- [x] New Feature Addition

#### Enhancement Description

The enhancement involves adding an email previewing feature to the existing MkSaaS template. This feature will allow users to create, edit, and preview email templates before sending them, ensuring that emails look professional and are free of errors.

#### Impact Assessment

- [ ] Minimal Impact (isolated additions)
- [x] Moderate Impact (some existing code changes)
- [ ] Significant Impact (substantial existing code changes)
- [ ] Major Impact (architectural changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals

- Provide a user-friendly interface for creating email templates.
- Allow users to preview email templates in real-time.
- Ensure email templates are responsive and look good on all devices.
- Integrate with existing email delivery systems (Resend).

#### Background Context

The MkSaaS template already has a robust foundation with authentication, payments, and content management. Adding an email previewing feature will enhance its capabilities, allowing users to create and manage professional-looking emails directly within the application. This feature is particularly useful for SaaS applications that need to send regular communications to their users.

2. FR2: Users can edit existing email templates.
3. FR3: Users can save email templates.
4. FR4: Users can delete email templates.
5. FR5: Users can preview email templates in real-time.
6. FR6: The preview is responsive and looks good on all devices.

8. FR8: Users can list all email templates.
9. FR9: Users can search for email templates by name.
10. FR10: Users can filter email templates by creation date.

### Non Functional

1. NFR1: The application should be responsive and work on all modern browsers.
2. NFR2: The application should be secure and protect user data.
3. NFR3: The application should be scalable to handle a large number of users.
4. NFR4: The email previewing feature should not significantly impact the performance of the existing application.
5. NFR5: The email previewing feature should integrate seamlessly with the existing MkSaaS template architecture.

### Compatibility Requirements

1. CR1: The new email previewing feature must integrate with the existing Better Auth authentication system.
2. CR2: The new email previewing feature must use the existing PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM.
3. CR3: The new UI components for email previewing must follow the existing design system (Radix UI, TailwindCSS).
4. CR4: The new feature must integrate with the existing Resend email delivery system.

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript
**Frameworks**: Next.js 15, React 19
**Database**: PostgreSQL
**Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Workers compatible, Docker support
**External Dependencies**: Better Auth, Stripe, Fumadocs, MDX, next-intl, React Email, Resend, Drizzle ORM, Radix UI, TailwindCSS

### Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: New tables for email templates and previews will be added using Drizzle ORM migrations.
**API Integration Strategy**: New Server Actions will be created for handling email preview requests.
**Frontend Integration Strategy**: New UI components will be created using Radix UI primitives and TailwindCSS.
**Testing Integration Strategy**: New tests will be added following the existing testing patterns.

### Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: Follow the established directory structure with clear separation between app routes, components, and feature modules.
**Naming Conventions**: Follow existing conventions (e.g., PascalCase for components, kebab-case for files).
**Coding Standards**: Follow MkSaaS template conventions with TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Radix UI.
**Documentation Standards**: Inline comments and README.md.

### Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Deploy as part of the existing Next.js application.
**Deployment Strategy**: Use existing deployment pipeline.
**Monitoring and Logging**: Use existing monitoring tools.
**Configuration Management**: Use existing environment-based configuration.

### Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: Potential for XSS vulnerabilities in email template previews.
**Integration Risks**: Ensuring new components integrate seamlessly with existing architecture.
**Deployment Risks**: Database migrations must be backward-compatible.
**Mitigation Strategies**: Sanitize email templates before rendering previews, follow existing architectural patterns, ensure database migrations are backward-compatible.

## Epic and Story Structure

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a single epic because it represents a cohesive feature set (email previewing) that builds upon the existing email functionality. Does this align with your understanding of the work required?

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single epic for email previewing enhancement with rationale

## Epic 1: Email Previewing Enhancement

**Epic Goal**: To provide users with the ability to create, edit, and preview email templates within the application.

**Integration Requirements**: The new feature must integrate with the existing authentication system, database, and email delivery system.
