# SaaS Application Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- IDE-based fresh analysis

#### Current Project State
This is a full-stack SaaS application built on Next.js 15 with App Router. The application includes essential SaaS features such as authentication, payments, internationalization, newsletter management, dashboard, blog, documentation, and UI components.

The system provides a comprehensive platform for users to manage various aspects of their digital communications and business operations. Multiple components work together to deliver a complete SaaS experience, including but not limited to email management, user authentication, payment processing, content management, and analytics. One specific component allows users to upload, select, and preview email files in various formats (.eml, .msg, .pst, .mbox, .html, .txt). The existing implementation includes drag-and-drop upload interface, email listing with search and filtering, and responsive email preview across different device types.

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Add AI-powered analysis features including spam detection and sentiment analysis to enhance the application's intelligence capabilities
- Implement automated categorization based on content analysis to improve user productivity across components
- Enhance the application's data processing capabilities with additional metadata and insights derived from content analysis
- Improve search and filtering capabilities across the application with AI-powered tags
- Maintain compatibility with all existing application functionality to ensure seamless user experience

#### Background Context
The SaaS application currently provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing digital communications and business operations. While several components offer basic functionality for uploading, listing, and previewing various file types, the system lacks advanced analysis capabilities that would provide users with deeper insights into their content. This enhancement will add AI-powered features to analyze content, detect spam, assess sentiment, and automatically categorize items, thereby strengthening the application's position as a comprehensive business productivity tool.

FR4: The system shall display analysis results including spam score, sentiment, and category in the preview interface
FR5: The system shall allow users to manually adjust categorization and provide feedback to improve AI accuracy
FR6: The system shall add AI-generated tags to items based on content analysis
FR7: The system shall enable filtering and searching items based on AI-generated tags, sentiment, and categories
FR8: The system shall maintain all existing upload, listing, and preview functionality without degradation

### Non Functional
NFR1: Content analysis must be completed within 2 seconds for items under 1MB
NFR2: The system must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 20%
NFR3: All AI analysis features must be accessible through the existing UI without requiring separate authentication
NFR4: The system must handle up to 100 concurrent analysis requests
NFR5: Content must be encrypted during AI analysis processing
NFR6: The system must provide clear error messages when AI analysis fails

### Compatibility Requirements
CR1: Existing API compatibility: All existing application APIs must remain unchanged
CR2: Database schema compatibility: No modifications to existing database schema are required for basic functionality
CR3: UI/UX consistency: New AI analysis features must follow existing design patterns and component library
