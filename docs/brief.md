# Project Brief: Email Previewer Application

## Executive Summary

The Email Previewer Application is an enhancement to the MkSaaS template, designed to provide users with a robust tool for creating, editing, and previewing email templates. This feature addresses the need for professional, error-free email communications within SaaS applications. The primary value proposition is to streamline the email creation process, ensuring high-quality, responsive emails that integrate seamlessly with the existing MkSaaS infrastructure.

## Problem Statement

Currently, users of the MkSaaS template who wish to send emails must either use external tools or manually code and test their email templates. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and often results in emails that don't render consistently across different email clients. The lack of an integrated email previewing solution within the MkSaaS template creates a gap in the development workflow, leading to potential delays in product launches and subpar user experiences.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to integrate a comprehensive email previewing feature directly into the MkSaaS template. This feature will include a user-friendly interface for creating and editing email templates, a real-time preview pane that accurately reflects how emails will appear in various email clients, and seamless integration with the existing Resend email delivery system. By providing an integrated solution, users can create, preview, and send professional-looking emails without leaving the MkSaaS environment.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Content Creators and Developers

Content creators and developers who use the MkSaaS template to build SaaS applications. These users need to send regular communications to their users, such as newsletters, password reset emails, and promotional messages. They value efficiency, reliability, and ease of use.

### Secondary User Segment: MkSaaS Template Maintainers

Maintainers of the MkSaaS template who want to provide a more comprehensive set of features to their users. They are interested in enhancing the template's capabilities while maintaining its ease of use and rapid development cycle.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- Increase user satisfaction with the MkSaaS template by 20% within 6 months of release.
- Reduce the time required to create and test email templates by 50%.
- Improve the quality of emails sent by MkSaaS users, as measured by reduced support requests related to email rendering issues.

### User Success Metrics

- 80% of users who create email templates use the preview feature.
- 90% of users report that the preview accurately reflects how their emails look in email clients.
- Average time to create and send an email template decreases by 50%.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Feature Adoption Rate**: Percentage of MkSaaS users who utilize the email previewer within 3 months of its release. Target: 30%.
- **Email Rendering Accuracy**: Percentage of emails sent through the previewer that render correctly across major email clients. Target: 95%.
- **User Satisfaction Score**: Average rating from users on the email previewer feature. Target: 4.5/5.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Email Template Creation**: Users can create new email templates with a name and HTML content.
- **Email Template Editing**: Users can edit existing email templates.
- **Email Template Listing**: Users can view a list of all their email templates.
- **Email Template Deletion**: Users can delete email templates they no longer need.
- **Real-time Preview**: Users can see a live preview of their email template as they edit it.
- **Responsive Preview**: The preview accurately reflects how the email will look on different devices.
- **Integration with Resend**: The previewer integrates with the existing Resend email delivery system.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced email template features (e.g., drag-and-drop editor, pre-built templates).
- Email A/B testing.
- Detailed email analytics.
- Integration with other email delivery services beyond Resend.

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if it allows users to create, edit, preview, and delete email templates with a high degree of accuracy and ease of use. User feedback should indicate that the feature significantly reduces the time and effort required to create professional-looking emails.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features

- Drag-and-drop email template builder.
- Library of pre-built email templates.
- Email A/B testing capabilities.
- More detailed email analytics.

### Long-term Vision

To become the go-to solution for email template creation and management within the MkSaaS ecosystem, offering advanced features and integrations that rival standalone email design tools.

### Expansion Opportunities

- Integration with other MkSaaS features (e.g., newsletter management).
- White-labeling options for agencies and enterprises.
- API access for programmatic email template creation.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms**: Web-based application running on modern browsers.
- **Browser/OS Support**: Latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Performance Requirements**: Real-time preview updates with minimal lag.

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Radix UI.
- **Backend**: Next.js Server Actions, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL.
- **Hosting/Infrastructure**: Cloudflare Workers compatible.

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure**: Follow the existing MkSaaS directory structure.
- **Service Architecture**: Leverage existing Server Actions for data mutations.
- **Integration Requirements**: Integrate with Resend for email delivery.
- **Security/Compliance**: Ensure email templates are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget**: Development resources are limited to the existing MkSaaS team.
- **Timeline**: Feature should be completed within 2 months.
- **Resources**: Limited to the current MkSaaS template codebase and team expertise.
- **Technical**: Must maintain compatibility with existing MkSaaS features and architecture.

### Key Assumptions

- Users are familiar with basic HTML for email template creation.
- The existing MkSaaS authentication and database systems are sufficient for this feature.
- Resend will continue to be the primary email delivery service for MkSaaS users.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Technical Risk**: Ensuring the preview accurately reflects how emails will render in various email clients.
- **Integration Risk**: Seamless integration with Resend and other MkSaaS features.
- **Adoption Risk**: Users may not adopt the feature if it's not intuitive or doesn't meet their needs.

### Open Questions

- What specific email clients should the previewer prioritize for accuracy?
- Should the MVP include any pre-built templates or components?
- How will user feedback be collected and incorporated into future iterations?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Best practices for email template rendering across different clients.
- User research to understand specific needs and pain points with current email workflows.
- Technical feasibility of advanced features like drag-and-drop editing.

## Next Steps

1. Finalize the project brief and obtain stakeholder approval.
2. Begin detailed design and architecture planning.
3. Start implementation of the MVP features.
4. Conduct user testing and gather feedback.
5. Iterate on the design and implementation based on feedback.
6. Prepare for release and documentation.
