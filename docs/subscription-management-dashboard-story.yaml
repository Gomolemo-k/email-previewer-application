dev_notes: |
  1. The existing billing system in `/src/app/[locale]/(protected)/settings/billing` provides a good starting point for the subscription management dashboard.

  2. The `useCurrentPlan` hook in `/src/hooks/use-payment.ts` already provides the necessary data for displaying current plan information.

  3. The `CustomerPortalButton` component in `/src/components/pricing/customer-portal-button.tsx` can be reused for redirecting users to Stripe's customer portal for complex subscription management actions.

  4. The existing pricing components in `/src/components/pricing/` can be referenced for consistent UI design.

  5. The database schema in `/src/db/schema.ts` shows that payment information is stored in the `payment` table, which includes fields for subscription status, period dates, and customer information.

  6. The Stripe integration in `/src/payment/provider/stripe.ts` handles all the backend logic for subscription management, so the frontend dashboard should primarily focus on display and user interaction.

testing:
  - Test with users on different plan types (free, subscription, lifetime)
  - Test error scenarios (network failures, API errors)
  - Test loading states
  - Test all action buttons and their confirmation flows
  - Test internationalization with both English and Chinese locales
  - Test responsive design on different screen sizes
  - Test accessibility features with screen readers
