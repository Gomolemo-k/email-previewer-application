# Project Context

This repository contains the SaaS application.  

⚠️ Important:
- Do **NOT** assume the project scope based on the repository or folder name.  
- The folder name `email-previewer-application` is misleading — the actual project is a full-stack SaaS application.  
- Always refer to:
  - [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) for development workflow and commands  
  - [`docs/architecture.md`](./architecture.md) for core architecture  
  - [`docs/frontend-architecture.md`](./frontend-architecture.md) for frontend-specific details  

These are the **single sources of truth** for the project identity and architecture.
