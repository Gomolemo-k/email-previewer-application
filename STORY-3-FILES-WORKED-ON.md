# Files Worked on for STORY-3 Implementation

## New Files Created

1. `/src/components/dashboard/email-file-table.tsx` - Email file table component to display uploaded files
2. `/src/app/api/get-email-files/route.ts` - API endpoint to retrieve user's email files
3. `/src/app/api/delete-email-file/[id]/route.ts` - API endpoint to delete user's email files
4. `/test-email.eml` - Test email file for verification

## Files Modified

1. `/src/app/[locale]/(protected)/dashboard/page.tsx` - Integrated email file table component
2. `/src/components/dashboard/email-upload.tsx` - Updated upload success callback
3. `/src/app/api/upload-email/route.ts` - Updated file naming convention
4. `/messages/zh.json` - Added Chinese translations for email file table component

## Files Referenced but Not Modified

1. `/src/components/dashboard/email-upload.tsx` - Existing upload component
2. `/src/app/api/upload-email/route.ts` - Existing upload API endpoint
3. `/messages/en.json` - Existing English translations (already had email file table translations)

## API Endpoints Created

1. `GET /api/get-email-files` - Retrieve all email files for the current user
2. `DELETE /api/delete-email-file/[id]` - Delete a specific email file by ID for the current user

## Components Created

1. `EmailFileTable` - Displays uploaded email files in a table format with preview and delete functionality

## Key Features Implemented

1. File upload with drag-and-drop interface
2. File storage with user-specific naming conventions
3. File table display showing filename, type, size, and upload date
4. File preview functionality with maximize/close capabilities
5. File deletion with user confirmation
6. User-specific file access enforcement
7. Internationalization support (English and Chinese)
8. Error handling and user-friendly messages
9. Responsive UI design

## Security Measures

1. Files are stored with user-specific naming conventions to prevent unauthorized access
2. API endpoints authenticate users before allowing file operations
3. Users can only see and delete their own files
4. File paths are not exposed to the frontend for security

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
1. Valid .eml and .html file uploads
2. File size limit enforcement (10MB)
3. File type validation
4. File table display
5. File preview functionality
6. File deletion functionality
7. User-specific file access enforcement
