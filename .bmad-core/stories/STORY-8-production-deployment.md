# STORY-8: Deploy the Application to Production

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a project lead, I want to deploy the completed, tested, and documented application to the production environment so that it is available to end-users.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application passes all integration tests
- A CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys the main branch to production
- The application is live and accessible at its public URL
- Final documentation is polished and published in Confluence

## Tasks
- [ ] Conduct final integration testing across all features
- [ ] Verify all core features (STORY-3, STORY-4, STORY-5) are complete and functioning
- [ ] Run performance tests to ensure application meets benchmarks
- [ ] Complete final security audit
- [ ] Prepare production environment (servers, databases, etc.)
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline for production deployment
- [ ] Execute production deployment from main branch
- [ ] Verify application is accessible at public URL
- [ ] Conduct post-deployment smoke tests
- [ ] Publish final documentation to Confluence
- [ ] Update version numbers and release notes
- [ ] Notify stakeholders of successful deployment

## Subtasks
- [ ] Run end-to-end tests for file upload functionality
- [ ] Run end-to-end tests for file listing functionality
- [ ] Run end-to-end tests for email preview functionality
- [ ] Test responsive design on various devices
- [ ] Verify all external integrations are working
- [ ] Check database connections and migrations
- [ ] Validate environment variables and configuration
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting systems
- [ ] Configure backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Prepare rollback plan in case of issues
- [ ] Execute CI/CD pipeline deployment
- [ ] Test application functionality in production environment
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates and HTTPS configuration
- [ ] Finalize and proofread Confluence documentation
- [ ] Organize documentation in appropriate Confluence spaces
- [ ] Create release notes document

## Dev Notes
- Need to coordinate with the development team for deployment execution
- Should schedule deployment during low-traffic period to minimize user impact
- Must have rollback plan ready before deployment
- Need to ensure all team members are available during deployment for immediate issue resolution
- Should coordinate with marketing team for launch timing
- May need to prepare announcement for users about new features
- Consider implementing feature flags for gradual rollout
- Need to verify all third-party services are properly configured in production
- Should test backup and restore procedures before going live

## Testing
- [ ] Verify all integration tests pass before deployment
- [ ] Confirm performance benchmarks are met
- [ ] Test application functionality in production environment
- [ ] Validate all external service integrations
- [ ] Check database connectivity and data integrity
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting systems are working
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Confirm SSL certificates are valid and properly configured
- [ ] Validate rollback procedures work correctly
- [ ] Verify documentation is accessible and accurate

## Out of Scope / Notes
- Post-production monitoring and maintenance are not included
