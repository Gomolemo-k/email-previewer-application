# STORY-4: User Can See a List of Uploaded Files

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user, after uploading files, I want to see them listed in a table so that I can easily view and manage all my uploaded emails.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A table on the main screen displays all uploaded files
- The table shows relevant metadata (e.g., File Name, Upload Date)
- The user can select a file from this table to preview it
- The PR for this feature is peer-reviewed and approved before merging

## Tasks
- [ ] Create UI component for file listing table
- [ ] Design table layout with appropriate columns for metadata
- [ ] Implement backend endpoint to retrieve list of uploaded files
- [ ] Connect frontend table to backend API
- [ ] Add file selection functionality
- [ ] Implement navigation to preview screen on file selection
- [ ] Add sorting capabilities to table columns
- [ ] Add pagination if there are many files
- [ ] Write unit tests for frontend and backend components
- [ ] Write integration tests for the file listing flow
- [ ] Create documentation for the file listing feature
- [ ] Submit PR for peer review

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design table UI/UX with columns for File Name, Upload Date, and other metadata
- [ ] Implement table component with proper styling
- [ ] Create API route to fetch file list

- [ ] Implement routing to preview screen
- [ ] Add sorting functionality to table headers
- [ ] Implement pagination controls if needed
- [ ] Add loading states while fetching data
- [ ] Add empty state when no files are uploaded

## Dev Notes
- Need to determine what metadata to display beyond File Name and Upload Date
- Should consider performance implications for large numbers of files
- Need to coordinate with STORY-3 for data structure of uploaded files
- Need to coordinate with STORY-5 for preview functionality
- Consider responsive design for the table on different screen sizes
- Think about accessibility for the table component

## Testing
- [ ] Test table displays correctly with various numbers of files (empty, few, many)
- [ ] Test file selection navigates to preview screen
- [ ] Test sorting functionality on all columns
- [ ] Test pagination if implemented
- [ ] Test error handling when file list cannot be retrieved
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Test accessibility of table component
- [ ] Test loading states
