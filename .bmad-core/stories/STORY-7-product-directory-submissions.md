## Dev Notes
- Need to ensure landing page is optimized for directory submissions
- Should coordinate with marketing team for consistent messaging across directories
- May need to create specific landing page versions for different directories
- Consider timing of submissions for maximum visibility
- Need to track performance metrics from each directory
- Should prepare for potential increase in support requests after listings go live
- May need to update directory listings with new features or improvements over time

## Testing
- [ ] Test all links in directory profiles direct to correct landing pages
- [ ] Verify all images display correctly on directory platforms
- [ ] Confirm descriptions are clear and compelling
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness of landing page from directory links
- [ ] Validate contact information is accurate and up-to-date
