# STORY-5: User Can Preview an Email on Different Screen Sizes

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user, when I select an email from the list, I want to see its content rendered in three separate preview panes—Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile—so that I can check its responsiveness at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Clicking a file in the list opens the preview view
- The preview area correctly renders the email's HTML content
- The content is displayed simultaneously in three views with widths corresponding to typical desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- The PR for this feature is peer-reviewed and approved before merging

## Tasks
- [ ] Create UI component for email preview view
- [ ] Design layout for three preview panes (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- [ ] Implement backend endpoint to retrieve email content
- [ ] Connect frontend preview component to backend API
- [ ] Implement responsive preview panes with appropriate dimensions
- [ ] Add loading states while email content is being fetched
- [ ] Handle errors when email content cannot be retrieved
- [ ] Write unit tests for frontend and backend components
- [ ] Write integration tests for the preview flow
- [ ] Create documentation for the preview feature
- [ ] Submit PR for peer review

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design preview UI/UX with three side-by-side panes
- [ ] Implement preview component with proper styling
- [ ] Create API route to fetch email content by ID
- [ ] Implement email content rendering logic
- [ ] Set dimensions for Desktop (1200px), Tablet (768px), and Mobile (375px) views
- [ ] Add scrollbars for content that exceeds pane dimensions
- [ ] Implement loading spinner or skeleton while content loads
- [ ] Add error handling and display user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add navigation back to file list
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works on different screen sizes

## Dev Notes
- Need to determine exact dimensions for each device type (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile)
- Should consider performance implications for rendering email content
- Need to coordinate with STORY-4 for file selection functionality
- Need to handle different email formats (.eml, .html) appropriately
- Consider security implications of rendering email HTML content
- Think about accessibility for the preview component
- May need to sanitize email HTML to prevent XSS attacks

## Testing
- [ ] Test preview opens correctly when selecting a file from the list
- [ ] Test email content renders correctly in all three preview panes
- [ ] Test different email formats (.eml, .html) render properly
- [ ] Test responsive preview panes display at correct dimensions
- [ ] Test loading states display correctly while content is being fetched
- [ ] Test error handling when email content cannot be retrieved
- [ ] Test navigation back to file list works properly
- [ ] Test accessibility of preview component
- [ ] Test performance with large email files
