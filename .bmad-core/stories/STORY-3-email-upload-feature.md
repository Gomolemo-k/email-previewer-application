# STORY-3: User Can Upload Email Files

## Status
Draft

## Story
As a user, I want to see an Upload button or a drag-and-drop area so that I can upload email files (e.g., .eml, .html) from my computer into the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The UI presents a clear, visible mechanism for file uploads (button + drag-and-drop zone)
- The system validates uploaded file types and rejects unsupported ones with a friendly error message
- Uploaded files are successfully received and persisted by the backend
- Errors during upload are logged and surfaced to the user
- The PR for this feature is peer-reviewed and approved before merging

## Tasks
- [ ] Create UI component for file upload (button + drag-and-drop zone)
- [ ] Implement frontend file validation for .eml and .html files
- [ ] Create backend endpoint to receive uploaded files
- [ ] Implement backend file type validation
- [ ] Implement file persistence mechanism
- [ ] Add error handling and logging for upload process
- [ ] Display user-friendly error messages for invalid files or upload failures
- [ ] Write unit tests for frontend and backend components
- [ ] Write integration tests for the upload flow
- [ ] Create documentation for the upload feature
- [ ] Submit PR for peer review

## Subtasks
- [ ] Design UI/UX for upload component
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Style upload component according to design system
- [ ] Create API route for file uploads
- [ ] Implement file type validation middleware
- [ ] Set up file storage (local/cloud)
- [ ] Implement error boundary for upload component
- [ ] Add loading states during upload process

## Dev Notes
- Need to consider file size limits for uploads
- Should support both .eml and .html file formats initially
- Consider accessibility for the upload component
- Need to implement proper security measures for file uploads
- Will need to coordinate with STORY-4 for file preview functionality

## Testing
- [ ] Test upload functionality with valid .eml files
- [ ] Test upload functionality with valid .html files
- [ ] Test rejection of unsupported file types with appropriate error messages
- [ ] Test upload with files exceeding size limits
- [ ] Test drag-and-drop functionality
- [ ] Test traditional button upload functionality
- [ ] Test error scenarios (network issues, server errors)
- [ ] Test accessibility of upload component
