# STORY-3: User Can Upload Email Files

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a user, I want to see an Upload button or a drag-and-drop area so that I can upload email files (e.g., .eml, .html) from my computer into the application.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The UI presents a clear, visible mechanism for file uploads (button + drag-and-drop zone)
- The system validates uploaded file types and rejects unsupported ones with a friendly error message
- Uploaded files are successfully received and persisted by the backend
- Errors during upload are logged and surfaced to the user
- The PR for this feature is peer-reviewed and approved before merging

## Tasks
- [x] Create UI component for file upload (button + drag-and-drop zone)
- [x] Implement frontend file validation for .eml and .html files
- [x] Create backend endpoint to receive uploaded files
- [x] Implement backend file type validation
- [x] Implement file persistence mechanism
- [x] Add error handling and logging for upload process
- [x] Display user-friendly error messages for invalid files or upload failures
- [ ] Write unit tests for frontend and backend components
- [ ] Write integration tests for the upload flow
- [ ] Create documentation for the upload feature
- [ ] Submit PR for peer review

## Subtasks
- [x] Design UI/UX for upload component
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] Style upload component according to design system
- [x] Create API route for file uploads
- [x] Implement file type validation middleware
- [x] Set up file storage (local/cloud)
- [x] Implement error boundary for upload component
- [x] Add loading states during upload process

## Dev Notes
- Need to consider file size limits for uploads
- Should support both .eml and .html file formats initially
- Consider accessibility for the upload component
- Need to implement proper security measures for file uploads
- Will need to coordinate with STORY-4 for file preview functionality

## Testing
- [x] Test upload functionality with valid .eml files
- [x] Test upload functionality with valid .html files
- [x] Test rejection of unsupported file types with appropriate error messages
- [x] Test upload with files exceeding size limits
- [x] Test drag-and-drop functionality
- [x] Test traditional button upload functionality
- [x] Test error scenarios (network issues, server errors)
- [ ] Test accessibility of upload component
