# STORY-3: User Can Upload Email Files

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a user, I want to see an Upload button or a drag-and-drop area so that I can upload email files (e.g., .eml, .html) from my computer into the application. I also want to see a table of my uploaded files with the ability to preview and delete them.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The UI presents a clear, visible mechanism for file uploads (button + drag-and-drop zone)
- The system validates uploaded file types and rejects unsupported ones with a friendly error message
- Uploaded files are successfully received and persisted by the backend
- Errors during upload are logged and surfaced to the user
- Users can view their uploaded files in a table format showing title, upload date, and file size
- Users can preview their uploaded files
- Users can delete their uploaded files
- The PR for this feature is peer-reviewed and approved before merging
